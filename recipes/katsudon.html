      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The most common style of katsudon in Japan is pork cutlet and onions
        cooked in a soy sauce-flavored sauce, mixed with egg, and served over
        rice. In most cases, pork cutlet is used for Katsudon, but there are
        also Katsudon using beef cutlet and chicken cutlet, called Beef Katsudon
        and Chicken Katsudon respectively.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>To Make Broth</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups water and 2-inch piece kombu in a 1-quart saucepan and set over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the kombu from the water just before it comes to a full boil.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup loosely packed dried bonito flakes, if using, and let the water come to a rapid simmer. Continue simmering for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and let the bonito steep in the broth for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the bonito flakes from the both. Add additional water, pouring through the strained bonito, if needed to make 2 cups.</li>
        <li>The broth can be used immediately, refrigerated for up to a week, or frozen for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, bring the dashi broth, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to a light boil.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To Prepare Ingredients</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the onion into wedges</li>
        <li>Beat the egg in a bowl</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To Make Tonkatsu</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>o prevent the pork from curling up, use a knife to cut the border between the fat and lean. **Be careful not to make a cut that goes all the way through, or the flavor and oil of the meat will be lost.</li>
        <li>Using your fingers, massage the meat to soften it. If there are any hard parts, use a knife to cut the tendons.</li>
        <li>Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour and sprinkle it evenly on both sides and remove excess flour.</li>
        <li>Dip in beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Dredge in panko and press gently. It doesn’t have to be fluffy because panko will pop up during deep frying.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To Deep Fry</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pot or pan to 350ºF (180ºC).</li>
        <li>Place a piece of panko or wooden chopsticks in the oil. When small bubbles appear around them, it’s ready to fry.</li>
        <li>Add in the pork. Fry for 3 minutes on each side or until crispy and golden brown. **If you over-fry it, the meat will lose its moisture and become less juicy and dry.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove excess oil by holding it vertically for a few seconds. Place it on the wire rack or paper towel and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the pork cutlet into 4-5 pieces by pressing the knife straight down instead of moving it back and forth.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To Cook Katsudon</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Serve the cooked rice in a donburi bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small frying pan (a frying pan for katsudon or oyakodon is recommended), add the broth that you have already made and onions and place over low heat. **Cover the frying pan with a lid if it’s possible (so the broth does not evaporate too quickly).</li>
        <li>When the onions are cooked, pour in the beaten egg all over. Stir lightly.</li>
        <li>Place the egg mixture on top of the rice when the egg is half-cooked.</li>
        <li>Place the cutlet over egg mixture and garnish with mitsuba-leaf or parsley as your choice.</li>
      </ol>
